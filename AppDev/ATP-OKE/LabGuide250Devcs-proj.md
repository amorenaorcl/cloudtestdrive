# Microservices on ATP #

## Part 1 - Setting up your Developer Cloud Project ##

## Introduction ##

In this lab, you’ll learn how to set up a new Developer project, based on a Github repository, and start modifying and automating the CI/CD steps for your environment.

## Why Oracle Developer Cloud Service? 

In recent years, the world of application development has adopted new methodologies that aim to improve the quality and speed with which applications are being delivered. The introduction of innovative development approaches, such as test-driven development and Agile development, gave rise to a set of new techniques and tools that enable those methodologies. Tools such as automatic build utilities combined with continuous integration platforms, as well as enhanced collaborative tools such as wikis and code review utilities, simplify the adoption of these new methodologies. 

However, for many IT shops, setting up these environments and maintaining them was difficult and cost prohibitive, so many organizations stuck to the old way of building applications. Oracle has changed this by introducing a simpler way to adopt modern development methodology and tools with a cloud-based offering known as Oracle Developer Cloud Service.

In this tutorial, you will work with DevCS and learn about some of its most important features.  

Let’s get started! 

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a project environment for your team

In this section, you’ll provision a complete development platform for your team by leveraging DevCS’s web interface.

  - <u>When using a Personal Trial</u>: Use the URL to your Developer Cloud Console you saved during the setup of your environment 

- On the Welcome page, click **New Project**.

- Give your project a name that begins with your own name, such as **JohnDunbarATPLab**, to make your project unique.  Then: 

  - Enter a **Description**, such as **ATP Lab Project**.

  - Leave the Security setting specified as **Private**.

  - Click **Next**

- Click **Empty Project**, then click **Next**.

- Select your preferred wiki markup language, then click **Finish**

- Wait while the project modules are provisioned, which can take a minute or two. You can see the indicators turn green as the associated modules are provisioned.

- When everything is provisioned, the project Home page opens, which contains details about your newly created project:

  Let’s take a look at this page (you may need to scroll to see the whole thing): 
  - On the left side is an activity feed. 
  - Tabs on the right side show you where the Git source code and Maven repositories are located.
  - Also on the right you can see project statistics, as well as the UI where you can manage team members.  Let’s take a look at that UI now. 


### Step 2:  Fetch and review code from the Git repository

- With the **Project Home** selected on the left menu, look to the right and select **Repositories**, then click **+ Create** button.

- In the New Repository dialog, enter these details: 
  - Type **ATPDocker** in the **Name** field.  In case you are sharing a repository with other participants, add your initials at the end of the name, like for example **ATPDocker_JLE**

  - Type **Microservices and ATP** in the **Description** field

  - Choose **Import Existing Repository** under **Initial content**

  - Enter https://github.com/amorenaorcl/ATPDocker.git in the text box: 

    ![](images/150/image10-2.png)

- Click **Create**.

  You should now be on the Code tab, which shows that you have a new DevCS git repository, NodeJSDocker.git.  This new repository contains imported code from the GitHub repository you specified.

### Step 3:  Cloning your repository locally

In order to easily update and upload files into your Developer repository, we will clone the newly created DevCS repository onto your (VM) machine.

- <u>open a Terminal window on your laptop
- In the home directory, create a directory where you will clone the repository, and move into this directory:

```
mkdir dev

cd dev
```

- Copy the URL of your newly created repository in Developer cloud, by navigating to the "Project Home" page on the left, then selecting the **Clone** button of your repository on the right.  Select **Clone with HTTPS** and the URL will be copied.

![](images/150/image013.png)

Now you can enter a command similar to the one below to clone your repository, pasting the URL you just copied 

`git clone https://<user_name>@ctddevcs-<instance_name>.developer.ocp.oraclecloud.com/ctddevcs-<instance_name>/s/ctddevcs-<instance_name>_atpdocker_1741/scm/ATPDocker.git`

This will result in following output:

**Copy/Move and unzip the ATP DB Wallet zip file into the ATPDocker directory just created**

- cd ATPDocker
- cp YourDownlodDir/Wallet_ATP1.zip .
- Unzip Wallet_ATP1.zip (in the same folder as your Dockerfile)
- git add .
- git comment -a -m "Added Wallet File"
- git push

**You are now ready to start configuring your CI/CD flows in this project!**
